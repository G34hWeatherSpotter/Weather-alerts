            "description": "A large north swell will quickly make its way into the area,\nreaching the northern Marshall Islands by Thursday night. These waves\nare being generated by a strong north Pacific cyclone currently\nabout 2000mi north-northeast of Wake Island. This system is\ncontinuing east-northeast into the central north Pacific packing\nwinds near hurricane/typhoon force on the western side of the system.\nWave model guidance shows 7-11 foot north swell with periods of\n14-17 sec around the peak of this event Friday - also well timed with\nthe full moon phase and its higher high tides. All this supports the\ndevelopment of hazardous surf and marine conditions for small craft.\nAdditionally for islands and atolls well exposed to the north, there\nwill be the increased threat for significant erosion and some minor\ninundation. Today's PacIOOS wave run-up guidance for Majuro still\nshows the potential for minor inundation around high tides. While\nmore southern atolls could see some shadowing from atolls farther\nnorth, the northernmost atolls will see the largest and unimpeded\nswells. The greatest risk for coastal inundation will be along north\nfacing shores exposed to the open ocean, but also within the lagoons\nas water can pile into lagoons if open to the ocean on their north\nand closed along the southern edge with few reef passes to allow\nwater to flow through.\n\nResidents should monitor local sea conditions and forecasts and be\nalert for minor flooding and debris on roads and property near shore\nlines, along with hazardous surf, swimming, and boating conditions.\nStay up to date with information from your Weather Service Office in\nMajuro, and any information shared from local emergency management\noffices. The latest Majuro forecasts can be found at\nweather.gov/gum/PublicForecasts.",
