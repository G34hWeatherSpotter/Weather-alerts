Surf is expected to fall below\nhazardous levels of 9 feet on Saturday, as the swell energy\ndissipates and seas decrease.",

Minor flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and\ndebris flows may occur with the most intense activity, especially\nin and around burn scars. Small hail will also be possible, along\nwith gusty winds.\n\nIn addition, a few of the more intense showers and thunderstorms\ncould produce funnel clouds. While tornadoes are not immediately\nlikely, the atmospheric conditions are favorable for storm\nrotation, and perhaps a couple of small, brief, and weak\ntornadoes. If a storm approaches your location, or if you sense\nthe winds picking up, or if you see a tornado, take shelter\nindoors and in the interior part of the lowest floor.",

            "description": "A large, long-period northerly swell is staring to make its way into\nthe region, reaching the northern Marshall Islands tonight and\nMajuro by Friday. These waves were generated by a strong north\nPacific cyclone currently about 2750mi northeast of Wake Island. Wave\nmodel guidance shows 7-11 foot northerly swell with periods of 14-17\nseconds around the peak of this event Friday - also well timed with\nthe full moon phase and its higher high tides. Drifting buoys through\nthe region overall support model guidance leading to high confidence\nin the strength of the swell. All this still supports the development\nof hazardous to dangerous surf and hazardous marine conditions for\nsmall craft. Additionally for islands and atolls well exposed to the\nnorth, there will be the increased threat for significant erosion and\nsome minor inundation. Today's PacIOOS wave run-up guidance for\nMajuro still shows the potential for minor inundation around high\ntides. While more southern atolls could see some shadowing from\natolls farther north, the degree of shadowing is uncertain and the\nnorthernmost atolls will see the largest and unimpeded swells.\n\nFor the northern islands, dangerous surf around 15 feet is likely,\nwith the greatest risk for coastal inundation along north facing\nshores exposed to the open ocean, and also within the lagoons. Water\ncan pile into lagoons if open to the ocean on their north side and\nclosed along the southern edge with few reef passes to allow water to\nflow through. This can cause debris to cover vulnerable property,\nroads and even airport runways. Sea heights will be around 12 to 14\nfeet, making inter-travel between island hazardous until the north\nswell starts to drop Saturday. Atolls such as Majuro, Kwajalein,\nJaluit, and Mili, may be shadowed by the more northern islands,\npotentially reducing the max surf and sea height, but how much\nshadowing the atolls will experience is uncertain. Current model\nguidance supports surf up to 11 feet at Majuro with seas around 9\nfeet, just under hazardous levels for surf and small craft\nrespectively. Minor coastal inundation is still possible, with the\ngreatest risk along north facing shores exposed to the open ocean and\nwithin the lagoons.\n\nResidents should monitor local sea conditions and forecasts and be\nalert for minor flooding and debris on roads and property near shore\nlines, along with dangerous surf, swimming, and boating conditions.\nStay up to date with information from your Weather Service Office in\nMajuro, and any information shared from local emergency management\noffices. The latest Majuro forecasts can be found at\nweather.gov/gum/PublicForecasts.",
