If you have to swim out of a rip current, swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.\n\nA High Surf Advisory means that high surf will affect beaches in\nthe advisory area, producing localized beach erosion and\ndangerous swimming conditions.",

Minor flooding, mud slides, rock slides, and\ndebris flows may occur with the most intense activity, especially\nin and around burn scars. Small hail will also be possible, along\nwith gusty winds.\n\nIn addition, a few of the more intense showers and thunderstorms\ncould produce funnel clouds. While tornadoes are not immediately\nlikely, the atmospheric conditions are favorable for storm\nrotation, and perhaps a couple of small, brief, and weak\ntornadoes. If a storm approaches your location, or if you sense\nthe winds picking up, or if you see a tornado, take shelter\nindoors and in the interior part of the lowest floor.",

Lack of\ntransportable snowfall, due to recent dry weather and wind, will\nlikely inhibit significant visibility reductions in blowing snow.\nHowever, a large open lead in the ice from Kaktovik to Mackenzie\nBay will support the potential for ocean-effect snow showers and\nbrief snow squalls along the coast, with brief periods of\nvisibility reduced to one half mile or less at times in snow\nsqualls.\n\nThere is a 30 to 50 % probability that visibility remains below a\nhalf mile or less for sustained periods. Should this occur, a\nwinter weather advisory for blowing snow will be issued.\n\nStay tuned to the latest forecast at www.weather.gov/afg",

These warm temperatures will drop\nrelative humidity values down to around 25% in western MN this\nafternoon into early evening. Winds will be increasing as well,\nwith sustained values expected to be at least in the 15-20 MPH\nrange, gusting to near 30 MPH. These winds with the low RHs will\nresult in near-critical fire weather conditions in western MN\ntoday. Overnight , we'll see an influx of moisture, so despite\nhighs in the mid 60s to mid 70s tomorrow, humidity values are not\nexpected to drop out of the 40s.\n\nCheck with local authorities about any burn restrictions before\nstarting fires.",

            "description": "A large, long-period northerly swell is staring to make its way into\nthe region, reaching the northern Marshall Islands tonight and\nMajuro by Friday. These waves were generated by a strong north\nPacific cyclone currently about 2750mi northeast of Wake Island. Wave\nmodel guidance shows 7-11 foot northerly swell with periods of 14-17\nseconds around the peak of this event Friday - also well timed with\nthe full moon phase and its higher high tides. Drifting buoys through\nthe region overall support model guidance leading to high confidence\nin the strength of the swell. All this still supports the development\nof hazardous to dangerous surf and hazardous marine conditions for\nsmall craft. Additionally for islands and atolls well exposed to the\nnorth, there will be the increased threat for significant erosion and\nsome minor inundation. Today's PacIOOS wave run-up guidance for\nMajuro still shows the potential for minor inundation around high\ntides. While more southern atolls could see some shadowing from\natolls farther north, the degree of shadowing is uncertain and the\nnorthernmost atolls will see the largest and unimpeded swells.\n\nFor the northern islands, dangerous surf around 15 feet is likely,\nwith the greatest risk for coastal inundation along north facing\nshores exposed to the open ocean, and also within the lagoons. Water\ncan pile into lagoons if open to the ocean on their north side and\nclosed along the southern edge with few reef passes to allow water to\nflow through. This can cause debris to cover vulnerable property,\nroads and even airport runways. Sea heights will be around 12 to 14\nfeet, making inter-travel between island hazardous until the north\nswell starts to drop Saturday. Atolls such as Majuro, Kwajalein,\nJaluit, and Mili, may be shadowed by the more northern islands,\npotentially reducing the max surf and sea height, but how much\nshadowing the atolls will experience is uncertain. Current model\nguidance supports surf up to 11 feet at Majuro with seas around 9\nfeet, just under hazardous levels for surf and small craft\nrespectively. Minor coastal inundation is still possible, with the\ngreatest risk along north facing shores exposed to the open ocean and\nwithin the lagoons.\n\nResidents should monitor local sea conditions and forecasts and be\nalert for minor flooding and debris on roads and property near shore\nlines, along with dangerous surf, swimming, and boating conditions.\nStay up to date with information from your Weather Service Office in\nMajuro, and any information shared from local emergency management\noffices. The latest Majuro forecasts can be found at\nweather.gov/gum/PublicForecasts.",

Description: ...HEAVIEST SNOW SHIFTING SOUTH WITH WINTER STORM...

.The narrow band of heavier snow has shifted south, and the gradient
has tightened up. As a result, areas across central Minnesota will
see less snow, so the Blizzard Warning was replaced with a Winter
Weather Advisory for Le Sueur, Nicollet, Brown, Watonwan, Rice, and
Goodue counties.

Areas to the south and east of those counties have a higher chance
of seeing whiteout conditions from heavy snow and strong wind, so a
blizzard warning remains in effect for those locations. In Pepin and
Eau Claire Counties, the Winter Storm Watch was replaced with a
Winter Storm Warning.

As for timing, snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour will develop
Wednesday morning and last into early Wednesday afternoon. Northwest
winds of 30 to 40 mph will accompany the snow, with occasional gusts
near 45 mph along I-90.

* WHAT...Snow and blowing snow expected. Total snow accumulations
between 2 and 7 inches. The highest amounts will be in the
southeast part of the county. Winds gusting as high as 30 to 40
mph.

* WHERE...Eau Claire and Pepin Counties.

* WHEN...From 7 AM to 7 PM CDT Wednesday.

* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Widespread blowing snow
could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions
could impact the Wednesday morning and evening commutes.

Description: ESFAPX

The final Spring 2025 Flood Outlook for Northern Michigan
indicates a near average probability of flooding due to snow melt
within major eastern Upper and northern Lower Michigan river
basins. This represents a decrease in probabilities due to snow
melt during the first half of March

This outlook covers Chippewa and Mackinac counties in eastern Upper
Michigan which includes the Pine River Basin...and the northern half
of Lower Michigan encompassing Au Sable...Boardman...Manistee...
Rifle...and Tobacco River basins.

The first table below lists the probabilities of reaching flood stage
(minor flooding)...as well as moderate and major flood levels for the
six forecast points within the Gaylord National Weather Service office
Hydrologic Service Area. Current (CS) and historical (HS) probabilities
of exceeding minor...moderate...and major flood stages are listed
for the valid time period. CS values indicate the probability of
reaching a flood category based on current conditions.

HS values indicate the probability of reaching a flood category based
on historical or normal conditions.

When the value of CS is greater than HS: the probability of exceeding
that level is higher than normal.

When the value of CS is less than HS: the probability of exceeding
that level is lower than normal.

Departure from normal of reaching flood stage is the difference between
the current projected chance for reaching flood stage (CS) and the
climatological normal (HS). For example...the Manistee River near
Sherman...with a Flood Stage of 15 feet...has a 16 percent chance
of reaching or exceeding flood stage. This is 4 percentage points
above normal. During the 90 day period listed...the typical probability
of the Manistee River near Sherman reaching flood stage is 12 percent.

The next table shows the chance that a particular river location could
rise above the listed stages in the specified 90 day period (high flow
forecast):

Spring flood outlooks are routinely issued in February and March in
order to give advance notice of possible flooding.  The long range
probabilistic outlooks given in the above tables contain forecast
values that are calculated using multiple season scenarios from 30
or more years of climatological data...and incorporated current
river levels...soil moisture conditions...snow water equivalent
values...as well as 30 and 90 day outlooks for temperature and
precipitation provided by the NOAA/NWS Climate Prediction Center.
Actual river crests will differ from this outlook if future
conditions differ significantly from forecast conditions...or if
ice jams develop.

...Current Conditions...

Recent rain and snow melt have reduced the likelihood going forward
of additional flooding due to melting snow...especially across
northern Lower Michigan.

Precipitation through the Summer months (June-August) was
generally from 75 to 125 percent of normal. Across eastern Upper
Michigan June was the wettest month of the summer with
precipitation 150 to 200+ percent of normal...things started to
dry out in July with below normal rainfall though most areas
received at least 50 percent of normal precipitation. A similar
trend was noted in August. Precipitation during the Fall months
(September-November) started out below normal for September (less
than 50 percent of normal with some areas less than 25 percent of
normal) and October (25 to 75 percent of normal). But November
precipitation was above normal in most locations...more than 200
percent of normal across northern Chippewa county and in the
higher terrain of eastern Antrim/western Otsego/northwest Kalkaska
counties mainly due to a significant lake effect snow event
during Thanksgiving weekend.

Precipitation for the Winter (December through February) featured
quite a bit of snowfall for the lake effect snowbelts. The
Gaylord NWS office set a new record snowfall for the winter of
149.5 inches. Sault Ste. Marie recorded its second snowiest winter
on record (138.9 inches)...Houghton Lake its third snowiest
winter (72.2 inches) and Traverse City tied its fourth snowiest
winter (125.1 inches). From a liquid equivalent precipitation
standpoint...Sault Ste. Marie recorded its 7th wettest winter on
record (9.94 inches/3.42 inches above normal).

Snow water equivalent in the snow pack across eastern Upper Michigan
is generally 3 to 4 inches across Mackinac and southeast Chippewa
county...and from 6 to 9 inches across the remainder of Chippewa
county. Across northern Lower snow water equivalent is less than 2
inches in areas that still have snow cover...and 1 to 3 inches
across areas of northwest Lower that still have snow cover.

Soil moisture is near normal across all of northern Michigan.
Streamflows on northern Michigan rivers are near normal thanks to
recent rain-on-snowmelt.

D2 (Severe) Drought conditions continue across parts of Leelanau...
Alpena...Benzie...Oscoda...Alcona...Manistee...Ogemaw...Iosco...
Gladwin...and Arenac counties.

Moderate (D1) Drought conditions also continue across parts of
Presque Isle...Montmorency...Grand Traverse...Kalkaska...Crawford...
Wexford...Missaukee...and Roscommon counties.

...Weather Outlook...

The 6 to 10 day outlook issued by the Climate Prediction Center
valid for the period of March 18-9 2025 is indicating a high
likelihood for above normal temperatures...and leaning toward
above normal precipitation.

The outlook for the Spring (March through May) indicates no
discernible trend with regard to temperatures (equal probabilities
for above...normal...and below normal temperatures)...and a 40 to 50
percent chance of above normal precipitation.

...Additional Information...

This is the final Spring Flood Outlook for 2025. Long range
probabilistic outlooks such as those given in the above tables are
issues during the last week of each month throughout the year.
