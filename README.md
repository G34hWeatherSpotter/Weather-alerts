# Weather Alerts Revamp

A web app that displays live weather alerts from the US National Weather Service (NWS), overlays them on a map, and lets you toggle the latest NWS radar mosaic.  
Built with HTML, Bootstrap, and Leaflet â€“ no backend required.

## Features

- **Live NWS Alerts:** Fetches all current US NWS alerts from [weather.gov](https://www.weather.gov/).
- **Map Visualization:** Alerts are shown on an interactive map using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), with polygons/areas and points correctly colored by severity.
- **NWS Radar Overlay:** Toggle the latest NWS radar mosaic (reflectivity) as a semi-transparent overlay above the base map and below the warnings.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle dark mode for better nighttime viewing.
- **Filters & Search:** Search alerts by text or filter by severity.
- **Location Filter:** Show only alerts near your current location (uses browser geolocation).
- **No Backend Needed:** Fully static, just serve the HTML file.

## How to Use

1. **Open `index.html`** in any modern browser.  
   You can host it anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)

2. **Map Controls:**
   - Use the "Show Alerts For My Location" button to center and filter to your location.
   - Search and filter alerts using the input and dropdown.
   - Use the "Toggle Radar" button to turn the radar overlay on or off.
   - Toggle dark mode with the ðŸŒ™ button in the top bar.
